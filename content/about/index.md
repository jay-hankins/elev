Hi, my name is Jay, and I know just enough about computers to be dangerous.

I’m a passionate technologist who has loved computers for as long as I can remember. I’m currently a Chaos Engineer at Salesforce. Before that, I was a Site Reliability Engineer, working on our public cloud operations, responding to incidents, and evangelizing reliability best practices to our software delivery teams.

Previously, I’ve worked at companies like Cisco and RSA Security, developing web apps, investigating malware, and taking down cyber fraud activity.

I love the web. I had dialup as a kid, but I realized I could build a website in Microsoft Word that loaded very fast (and looked marvelous in Internet Explorer)! Then later on, I installed Firefox, got interested in CSS 2 and WYSIWYG editors (Nvu/KompoZer), and I very specifically remember making a website for my school with [this theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20120317130325/https://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3560/). In high school, I made some Wordpress themes for local businesses. And now, I use things like React and Parcel and VS Code. The web is pure, unadulterated techno-fun.

I studied Computer Science at Purdue University. I love to help people learn new things; at Purdue, I lectured [CS 190: Tools](https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/CS-190-F2016), where my team and I taught 500 computer science freshmen the basics of Unix-like terminals, text editors, and git.
