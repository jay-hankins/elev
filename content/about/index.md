Hi, my name is Jay, and I know just enough about computers to be dangerous.

I’m a passionate technologist who believes in bringing people and the power of technology together. I’m currently a Chaos Engineer at Salesforce. I was previously a Site Reliability Engineer, working on public cloud operations, responding to incidents, and evangelizing reliability best practices to our software delivery teams.

Previously, I’ve worked at companies like Cisco and RSA Security, developing web apps, investigating malware, and taking down cyber fraud activity.

I love the web. I had dialup as a kid, but I realized I could build a website in Microsoft Word that loaded very fast (and looked marvelous in Internet Explorer)! Then later on, I found out about Firefox, and CSS 2, and WYSIWYG editors (Nvu/KompoZer) and I very specifically remember making a website for my school with this theme. In high school, I made some Wordpress themes for local businesses. And now, I use things like React and Parcel and VS Code. The web is pure, unadulterated techno-fun.

I have a B.S. in computer science from Purdue University. But, while I can speak to machines, I'd rather talk to people. I love to help people learn new things; at Purdue, I lectured CS 193: Tools, where my team and I taught 500 computer science freshmen the basics of Unix-like terminals, text editors, and git.
