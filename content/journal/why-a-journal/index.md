I quite like the idea of having a personal space on the internet. My own little corner of the www.

But I'm not just a techy boi. There's more that I want to share, want to write about. There's more to me! And, for better or worse, my blog is mostly just technical stuff. I love to classify and organize information. Things that are less tech, and are more... me and my thoughts... will go here in the journal.

I believe that personal websites are a canvas for us digital creatives. This journal will be a place to experiment with that. For the moment, I'm keeping it simple:
* the font is different. a serif, for added pizazz.

That's it. Groovy. Talk to you later.
