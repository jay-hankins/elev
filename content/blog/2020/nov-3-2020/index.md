I'm 25 years old at the time of this U.S. election. I hope it's the most "exciting" election of my lifetime.

By which I mean, I hope Americans have overwhelmingly voted for a change. I hope we voted so hard to defend immigrants, women, gay people, healthcare workers, laborers, children, Black people, and on and on.

For posterity's sake, I will link a few articles about the tumultuous Trump presidency.

I continue to press on through the anxiety. I hope you are doing so too.
