Just noticed that we're coming up on 10 years of this website (it was previously hosted at jayhankins.me, but I'm still in the mood to celebrate).

It looked something like this, though I think Internet Archive might have missed some of the CSS: ![](jayhankins.me-screenshot.png)

A lot's changed since then, naturally. Barack Obama was still the U.S. President when I put this bad boy together. Taylor Swift had just released *Shake It Off*, Sia too with *Chandelier*, and I had them both on replay doing my freshman coding projects at Purdue. Oh, and I still had hair.
