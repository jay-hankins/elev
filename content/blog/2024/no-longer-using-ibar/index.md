When Bartender ~~went away~~ [was bought out and suspiciously changed owners](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/alternatives-bartender-mac-menu-bar/), I moved on to iBar. It seems iBar now has a Pro version that you must subscribe to in order to allow right-clicking on icons it has hidden (lol). I've ditched it, and moved to [Ice](https://icemenubar.app/), which is a delight to use.
